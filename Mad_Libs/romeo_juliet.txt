Two (PLURAL NOUN[1]), both alike in dignity,
In fair (PLACE[2]), where we lay our scene,
From ancient '(NOUN[3])' break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross`d (PLURAL NOUN[4]) take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their (NOUN[5]) bury their parents` strife.
The fearful passage of their (ADJECTIVE[6]) love,
And the continuance of their parents` rage,
Which, but their children`s end, nought could (VERB[7]),
Is now the (NUMBER[8]) hours` traffic of our stage;
The which if you with (ADJECTIVE[9]) (BODY PART[10]) attend,
What here shall (VERB[11]), our toil shall strive to mend.
